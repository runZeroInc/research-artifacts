# research-artifacts

This is a collection of runZero research artifacts, toys, and experiments.

## Everything in this repo is experimental

If a particular artifact here grows beyond a mere curiosity, it will likely get moved to a proper first-class repository. Until then, assume everything here has **sharp edges**. Imagine it as a kitchen junk drawer of screwdrivers, knives, Post-It™ notes, and spiders.

Use at your own risk, which is ultimately what the [LICENSE](LICENSE) says anyway.

Have fun!
